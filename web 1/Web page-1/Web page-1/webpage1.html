        <h1>Cloud Coumputing </h1>

        <h2> Introduction of cloud computing</h2>
        <p> Cloud computing is using remote services on the internet for carrying out a task, rather than using our
            computer .cloud computing is a resource installing and maintaining them not physically but also virtually.
            It often has functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center. Cloud
            computing is Based on sharing resources to achieve coherence and typically uses a model. Which can help in
            reducing capital expenses </p>
        <h2>How cloud computing works</h2>
        <p>cloud computing workes in 3 main ways: </p>
        <ol>

            <li><b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b></li>
            <div class="img-top-div"><img src="saas.jfif"></div>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>SaaS is a very popular form of cloud computing for specially small busses by using this, you can
                    access internet-hosted software apps using a browser rather than traditional apps stored on your own
                    computer</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <li><b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b></li>
            <div class="img-mid-div"><img src="aas.jfif"></div>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>IaaS means buying or renting your computer power and disk space from an external service provider.
                    It allows you to access through a private network</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <li><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</b></li>
            <div class="img-bottom-div"><img src="pass.jfif"></div>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>PaaS is usually described as a crossover of Saas and IaaS. It rents the hardware, operating system,
                    storage, and maybe network capacity that provides IaaS. PaaS offers more control over the technical
                    aspects.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </ol>
        <h2>The adventages of cloud computing</h2>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>1:Multi-tenancy</th>
                <th>2:Location and Device Independence</th>
                <th>3:Allows pay-per-use</th>
                <th>4:Always available, and scales automatically to adjust to the increase in demand</th>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Disadvantagers of cloud computing</h2>
        <p>Cloud computing has lower bandwidth and can have some technical issues which is very annoying, and the most
            important part is security time another drawback while working with cloud computing services is a security
            risk</p>
